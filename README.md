# PyTel : Car Telemetry Analysis tool

## When passions meets work
IT and Motorsport are my passions, so why not combining them into one project?

## My ultimate project
This project will come right after PyBank is finished. While PyBank V2 will be made in just 2 weeks,
PyTel will take at least 1 year of development.

## From simracing to real life
As major tools were mainly developped for real life, I will try to do the opposite, going from simracing to real life, but every versions will be natively properly working for every platform available.

## Tech stack

At the moment I have no clue. It'll surely come later.

## DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

This is the real business here, as I said, we will go from 
**simracing** to **real life**, here are all the steps :

-**Assetto Corsa / Assetto Corsa Competizione** - Racing application

-**BeamNG** -Road application

-**Assetto Corsa EVO** - Racing/Road application 
*(when the game will be 1.0)* 

-**OBDII** - Road application

-**ECU** - Road application

-**BeamNG** - Racing application
*(when tire model will finally come out)*

-**RFactor2** - Racing application

-**ECU EVO** - Racing application

-**IRacing** - Racing application
*(if I have enough money)*

## Racing vs Road : what's the difference and why it matters?
