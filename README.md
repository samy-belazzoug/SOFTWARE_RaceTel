# PyTel : Real time car telemetry analysis tool

## When passions meets work
IT and Motorsport are my passions, so why not combining them into one project?

## From simracing to real life
As major tools were mainly developped for real life, I will try to do the opposite, going from simracing to real life, so every versions will be natively properly working for every platform available.

## Tech stack

Note : It can change in the future, but this is will be approximately :
Back-end : Python, C++, C
Front-end : QT 6

## My goals
Of course, my goal is not to be a direct rival of MoTec I2, Cosworth PI and so on. 
I don't even think can all alone. I just want to show my abilities in :

-Reverse engineering

-High frequency, data engineering.

-Understanding of motorsport / cars

-Software development

-Real time programming

-Performance engineering

My professional dream would be to work in the Automotive industry, especialty Motorsport, whether it can be simulations or real life. So this project will be my "Automotive developer" portfolio.

## DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
This is the real business here, as I said, we will go from 
**simracing** to **real life**, here are all the steps :

-**Assetto Corsa** - Racing application

-**BeamNG** -Road application

-**OBDII** - Road application

-**ECU** - Road application

-**BeamNG** - Racing application
*(when tire model will finally come out)*

-**ECU EVO** - Racing application

## Racing vs Road : what's the difference and why it matters?
