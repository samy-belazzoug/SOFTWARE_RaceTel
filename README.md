# SOFTWARE_PyTel

## When passions meets work
IT and Motorsport are my passions, so why not combining them into one project?

## My ultimate project
This project will come right after PyBank is finished. While PyBank V2 will be made in just 2 weeks,
PyTel will take at least 1 year of development.

## From simracing to real life
As major tools were mainly developped for real life, I will try to do the opposite, develop a software for Assetto Corsa,
then BeamNG, RFactor2 if I really want and we'll go to real Road cars with OBD2, then ECU, and then, slowly but surely racecars!

## Tech stack

At the moment I have no clue. It'll surely come later.
